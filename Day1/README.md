## Details  

### Hello World 🌍
**Script**: [hello_world.py](Hello_World.ipynb)  
The classic first step into any programming language, where the computer simply says hello to the world!  

### Your Name and Age 🤔  
**Script**: [name_and_age.py](Input.ipynb)  
Ask for a name and age, then return personalized feedback. This demonstrates Python’s **input()** function and string handling.  

### Hogwarts Connect: If-Else Statements 🪄  
**Script**: [hogwarts_connect.py](ifElse.ipynb)  
A magical script that connects Hogwarts houses with their respective members using **if-elif-else** logic.  

### Sheldon’s While Loops 🛋️  
**Script**: [sheldons_loops.py](while.ipynb)  
From Sheldon’s best friend to “Knock Knock Penny,” this script creatively uses **while loops** for interactive scenarios.  

### Range and Loops 🔁  
**Script**: [range_and_loops.py](forLoop.ipynb)  
Shows how to use the `range()` function with **for loops**, including various step sizes, for efficient iteration.  

### The Squid Games 🦑  
**Script**: [squid_games.py](builtInFunctions.ipynb)  
A playful script inspired by Squid Games, using **while loops**, randomness, and fun messages.  

### Functions and Games 🎮  
**Script**: [functions_and_games.py](function.ipynb)  
1. **Hello Function**: Greets the user and counts characters in their name.  
2. **Magic 8 Ball Game**: Predicts the future with mysterious answers.  
3. **Scope Exploration**: Highlights **local** and **global scope** usage.  
4. **Guess the Number**: A number guessing game that combines loops and conditions.  

### Lists and Beyond 📜  
**Script**: [lists_and_beyond.py](Lists.ipynb)  
1. Explore **list operations** like `append()`, `remove()`, and `sort()`.  
2. Learn about **shallow vs. deep copies** for managing data effectively.
