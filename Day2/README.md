# Day 2: Diving Deeper into Python Programming 🐍💡

Welcome to **Day 2** of my Python learning journey! Today, I delved deeper into more advanced topics, including file handling, error handling, web scraping, data manipulation, and even built a Tic Tac Toe game. Here's a breakdown of everything I worked on today, with links to the corresponding code.

## Details  

### File Handling 🗂️  
**Script**: [Files.py](#)  
In this section, I worked on **reading**, **writing**, and **appending** to text files. This is crucial for working with persistent data, such as saving results to a file or processing data stored externally.

### Error Handling & Logging ⚠️  
**Script**: [error_handling.py](#)  
I learned to use **try-except** blocks to manage exceptions, and utilized the `traceback` module to log detailed error information to a file. I also explored **assert** statements and logging messages with various severity levels.

### Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup 🌐  
**Script**: [htmlParser.py](#)  
I used **requests** and **BeautifulSoup** to fetch content from a Wikipedia page. By parsing the page, I was able to extract the title of the article dynamically, a useful technique for web scraping.

### Data Manipulation with Pandas 📊  
**Script**: [htmlParser.py](#)  
Here, I explored **pandas** for data manipulation. I cleaned and transformed CSV data, handled missing values, and sorted the data based on the 'median_income' column to gain insights into the dataset.

### Working with Dictionaries 📚  
**Script**: [dictionary.py](#)  
In this section, I worked with **dictionaries** to store and manipulate data. I practiced adding, updating, and deleting dictionary entries, and also used dictionaries for counting letter occurrences in a string.

### Tic Tac Toe Game 🎮  
**Script**: [ticTacToe.py](#)  
I created a simple **Tic Tac Toe** game where a player competes against the computer. The game includes dynamic board updates, error handling for invalid inputs, and checks for winning combinations.

## Reflection  

Today was an exciting dive into more advanced Python topics! I gained hands-on experience with file handling, error handling, web scraping, and data manipulation. Building the Tic Tac Toe game was especially fun and helped reinforce logic and user interaction. Looking forward to Day 3! 🚀
