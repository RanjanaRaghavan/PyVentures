## Day 1  

### Hello World 🌍  
**Script**: `print("Hello World")`  
The classic first step into any programming language, where the computer simply says hello to the world!  

### Your Name and Age 🤔  
**Script**: Ask for a name and age, then return personalized feedback.  
Dive into Python's **input()** and **string methods**, showcasing how to work with user input dynamically.  

### Hogwarts Connect: If-Else Statements 🪄  
**Script**: A magical script that connects Hogwarts houses with their respective members. It explores **if-elif-else** logic with fun Hogwarts themes.  

### Sheldon’s While Loops 🛋️  
**Script**: From Sheldon’s best friend to “Knock Knock Penny,” this script creatively uses **while loops** and **input validation** to engage users in interactive scenarios.  

### Range and Loops 🔁  
**Script**: Demonstrates how to use the `range()` function with **for loops**, including various step sizes. A great way to iterate efficiently!  

### The Squid Games 🦑  
**Script**: A playful script that recreates the Squid Games theme using **while loops**, **randomness**, and some fun messages to keep players engaged.

1. **Hello Function**: Greets the user with their name and its character count.  
2. **Magic 8 Ball Game**: Predicts your future with mysterious answers!  
3. **Scope Exploration**: Explains **local** and **global scopes** with practical examples.  
4. **Guess the Number**: A number guessing game that combines loops, conditions, and error handling.  

### Lists and Beyond 📜  
**Script**:  
1. Explore **list operations** like `append()`, `remove()`, and `sort()`.  
2. Unpack lists into variables for clear and concise handling.
